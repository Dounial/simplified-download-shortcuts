# This package contains useful install/download-abbreviations for different distros
<p>also known as shortcuts and/or commands, it is mainly aimed to simplify and</p>
<p>save time with shortening the blunt linux-command-download every user uses</p>
<p>I don't program or contribute usually but I searched for a similar package</p> <p>without success so I created this - if you want to add a download-option</p>
<p>or any other distro-package-manager make sure to contact me on my GitHub-page</p>
